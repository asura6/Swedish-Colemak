# Swedish-Colemak
A Colemak layout for X11 customized for Swedish

# Installation
Make backups of your original files.

Replace the /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/se and /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/evdev.xml with the files in this repository.

Alternatively run the install bash script by entering "./installsec" in the terminal with the script in the working directory.

System updates are prone to overwriting the layout files.
